  "La ö" goes big !
  Could "La ö" restaurant be turned as a franchise business into other montpellier ? 
  
  Introduction
  
  Two very friends of mine, Laura and Denis, are hosting a very good and cheap restaurant in Montpellier,France. You can get more detail on the venue and the delicisous meals they propose daily (homemade!) on their facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/restaurant.la.o/). The restaurant is located in a suburb in the artfx school (https://artfx.school/) and propose lunch mostly to students and white-collar people of the sourroundings. If you go to this city, feel free to drop yourself there and tell to Laura that you got this address from Christophe of Zoufftgen. (ask the the Poutine meal...)
  In order to pursue their adventure, Laura and Denis would be interesting to see if "La ö" could be turned as a franchise restaurant business. Hence several question
  - Where do we find neighborhoods in Montpellier and other cities that are similar to the current one of "La ö"? (in terms of inhabitants, working customer, business and venues) 
  - What are the competitor that they may face in those simlar neighboor hood?
  - What are the ratings of those competitors compared to the ones of La ö?
  - What is the trend of each neighborhood in the next 10 years? 
 
 Data requirement

    The aim is to improve the ambulatory surgery policy of a hospital in order to reallocate surgeries currently requiring non-ambulatory process to less expensive ambulatory process. Of course the quality of care of the patient shall stay the same.   The health care professionals should be reallocated and trained to support this shift.

Currently the ambulatory surgery is only available for some specific kinds of surgery. Not all kind of surgeries can be moved to ambulatory mode.

As ambulatory is known to be cheaper for the hospital because beds are not occupied full time, the saved money would be reallocated to non-ambulatory surgeries which may require more technical and human resources to be achieved with the best quality.
